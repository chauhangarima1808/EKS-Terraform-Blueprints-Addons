# EKS-Terraform-Blueprints-Addons

A comprehensive project deploying a sample web application using Terraform EKS modules and add-ons. My focus was on establishing robust networking, efficient cluster provisioning, essential add-ons, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure a seamless deployment experience. The solution includes a multi-AZ VPC with private and public subnets, Amazon EKS running across private subnets, ELB for traffic routing, auto-scaling for dynamic capacity management, and CloudWatch Observability for real-time monitoring.

## Project Highlights
- A multi-AZ VPC with private and public subnetsfor secure and scalable networking.
- Amazon EKS control plane and worker nodes running across private subnets.
- EKS Managed Node Groups with auto-scalingfor dynamic workload management.
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for routing external traffic.
- CloudWatch Observability for real-time monitoring.

## Architecture

### Target architecture
![Architecture Diagram](/eks-architecture.png "Architecture Diagram")

### Target technology stack 
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** EKS clusters are provisioned and auto-scaling node groups are used to efficiently handle workloads.
- **VPC** A multi-AZ VPC with private and public subnets ensures secure, scalable networking for the EKS deployment.
- **NAT GATEWAYS** Used to allow outbound internet access for worker nodes in private subnets.
- **CloudWatch Container Insights** Collects metrics and logs from the EKS pods, enabling proactive monitoring of CPU, memory, and performance metrics.
- **EKS Add-ons** Enhance the Amazon EKS clusters with production-grade add-ons for networking, observability, security, and scalability using Terraform Blueprints.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  using IAM roles are assigned to nodes in the EKS cluster to ensure secure access control.

## Key Learnings
- Terraform simplifies infrastructure as code (IaC), making EKS and VPC deployments scalable and repeatable.<br>
- A well-architected VPC with private subnets improves security and isolation.<br>
- EKS Blueprints Add-ons optimize networking (VPC-CNI), observability (CloudWatch), AWS Load Balancer controller.<br>
- CloudWatch Container Insights offers real-time monitoring for proactive issue resolution.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to architect and deploy a production-ready Kubernetes environment on AWS using Terraform, with a strong focus on scalability, security, observability, and operational excellence. By leveraging Terraform EKS modules, VPC modules, and curated add-ons like VPC-CNI, CloudWatch, and the AWS Load Balancer Controller, we ensured a streamlined deployment experience and a resilient infrastructure foundation.

Through the integration of CloudWatch Container Insights, real-time visibility into cluster health and application performance is achieved, enabling proactive operations and rapid troubleshooting. The use of multi-AZ networking, private subnets, and IAM-based access control enhances both the reliability and security posture of the solution.

This end-to-end solution is not only scalable and cost-efficient but also adheres to AWS and Kubernetes best practices—making it an ideal blueprint for deploying containerized applications in enterprise environments.
